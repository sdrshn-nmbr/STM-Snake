# First Project Progress Report

First and foremost, **upload any and all work you have done so far.**  This includes code libraries, data sets, and any other resources you have used or created to build the project.

## Project Goals

1. Who is your team?  Provide a brief description of what your project is doing.  No fancy language - just describe what the project is and what purpose it achieves for a user.

**TODO**

## Progress

2. Provide a timeline of what you have done so far for the project, starting from the earliest date that you started working on the project.  Please mention which team member worked on which bit.

**TODO**

3. For each of the parts aside from the STM32F091 microcontroller that you are using in your project, provide a progress update.  This includes all parts in your kit and out of it.  For parts from outside your kit, **include the relevant datasheet as a link** (or if not possible, upload the file in this **docs** folder).  Describe what code you have written so far in terms of interfacing with these parts.

**TODO**

## Next Steps

4. Provide a timeline of what you plan to do next for the project, before your final demonstration in the week of Apr 15-19.  Mention who is planning to work on which bit.  If there are parts you have not yet received, or have not yet started working with, mention them here, with an estimate time of how long it will take to figure it out.  If you were told to mention parts that weren't in your initial project proposal, please do so here.

**TODO**

5. Mention your planned completion date here.  Typically, this is the day of your planned final demonstration, but should ideally be a few days earlier that that.

**TODO**

## Challenges

6. Mention any challenges you have faced so far in the project that you are concerned may keep you from finishing.  (Don't put these off too long - if you are stuck, please ask for help!)

**Before pushing anything, please follow the instructions below carefully.**  

Create a new branch called **first-report** in your repository.  Commit and push this file to that branch.  **Do not push it to main!**.

Then, create a pull request titled "First Project Progress Report".  The base should be **main**, and the compare should be your new branch **first-report**.  Request a review from your instructor, and submit the pull request for grading.  **Do not merge it without receiving approval.**  If you have to make updates, you do not have to close or merge the pull request - just push new commits to the **first-report** branch.
