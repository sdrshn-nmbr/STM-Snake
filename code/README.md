As a reminder, a typical PlatformIO project has the following structure:

- platformio.ini - tells PlatformIO how to build your project and flash it to your board
- openocd.cfg - tells the OpenOCD program how to connect to your board
- src/ - contains the source code for your project
    - main.c - the main file for your project
    - other files - any other source files you want to include in your project
- lib/ - contains any libraries you want to include in your project
- include/ - contains any header files you want to include in your project

You may follow any format you wish, but it would be in your best interest to keep things organized.

You can remove this file if you want, or make it a "discussion" or "issues" file.
