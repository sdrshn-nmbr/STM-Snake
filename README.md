# Snake

## Description
Implementing Snake on the STM32 Microcontroller

DEMO VIDEO: https://youtu.be/ZJFSy6JlUNE

## Instructions
If you just created this repository, do the following things:

1. If you haven't already, read the course project introduction slides on Piazza Resources.  Form a team of 3 or 4 team members and start brainstorming ideas for your project proposal.

1. If you wish to add team members yourself via the repository, click on Settings > Collaborators and Teams, and click on the team that has been added already under "Manage Access".  Add your team members to the repository.  

1. Brainstorm project ideas with your team.  Discuss your ideas with course staff to determine feasibility and whether it counts as a sufficiently complex project to be worth the bonus credit.  

1. Read `docs/initial_proposal.md` and follow the instructions there.  Also look out for any announcements your instructors may make regarding the project (just in case we have to correct any mistakes).  Follow the instructions in the file to fill out and submit the proposal.

1. Over time, we'll release templates for the revised proposal, first report and final report, as new commits to your `main` branch.  Pull those changes in when they appear or are announced, and follow the instructions in the new files.

## Suggestions

Read the project introduction slides on Piazza if you haven't already.  Other lectures pertaining to the project will be released over time in the Course Project section of Piazza Resources.

GitHub has documentation on how to properly use your repository for a project.  You can find it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/planning-and-tracking-work-for-your-team-or-project#creating-a-repository).  You should read it to understand how to use GitHub for your project.

Consider using a "Kanban board" to manage your project.  GitHub has a built-in Kanban board feature (if you can access it), or you can use a third-party service like [Trello](https://trello.com/templates/engineering/kanban-template-LGHXvZNL).  You can also use GitHub's Issue tracker to manage bugs and bug resolutions.  This allows staff to see what you're working on, what you've completed, and what you're having trouble with.

If there is a part you've found that is not in your kit that you would really like to use, consider visiting the ECE shop to see if they might have it.  Be sure that the part is not too expensive, and that it will work with your STM32 - you have to consider things like current draw, voltage levels, and clocking frequency.  If you're not sure, ask us.
